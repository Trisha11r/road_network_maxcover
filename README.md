# Finding shortest path covering maximum stoppages in a disrupted road network.

## Tasks performed:

- Representation of a set of coordinates (here, bus stoppages) mapped on the map of Kolkata city forming a route as a graph structure.
- Finding the shortest path to reach a stoppage from the previous one as mentioned in the bus route. In this case, the bus route covers all the stoppages in minimum time.
- Next, when one or more stoppages become inaccessible, finding a shortest possible route avoiding those stoppages such that maximum number of other stoppages is covered and time taken is minimum.
